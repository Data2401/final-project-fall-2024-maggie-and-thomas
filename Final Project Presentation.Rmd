## Introduction

Our project is about obesity.

Obesity has emerged as a critical public health concern globally. 

Obesity is a metabolic disorder. 

Obesity is a multifaceted problem: both social factors and biological factors. 

## The goal:

1. The relationship of obesity and daily calories intake 
2. The impact of economic geography on the prevalence of obesity in the respective population

## Datasets

Two datasets from Kaggle.

1. Obesity prevalence in countries and regions around the world.
2. The amount of daily calories intake per capita in the respective countries and regions.


## Packages Required


```{r}
# Load packages to be used
library(tidyverse) ## Loaded for dplyr
library(ggplot2) ## Loaded for plotting

```


##  Data Preparation


```{r}
# Read in data to be examined
raw_data_1 <- read.csv(file = "Obese population.csv",stringsAsFactors = T)
raw_data_2 <- read.csv(file = "Average calories.csv",stringsAsFactors = T)
```

This data is obtained from Kaggle.

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nipasriwongsiridech/calories-data?resource=download&select=Obese+population.csv 

It was collected by NIPASRI WONGSIRIDECH.
Published on on March 28th 2024.

All of the missing data removed 

```{r}
sum(is.na(raw_data_1)) # Returns the number of missing data values to determine that missing data exists
obese_data <- na.omit(raw_data_1) # Remove the observations with missing data
sum(is.na(raw_data_2)) # Returns the number of missing data values to determine that missing data exists
calories_data <- na.omit(raw_data_2) # Remove the observations with missing data
```

Have a look of raw data

```{r}
glimpse(obese_data)
glimpse(calories_data)
```

Join these two datasets, but first we pivot longer these two datasets to have a column of year for each dataset. Then, we join them by geography and year.


```{r}
library(dplyr)

obese_data <- obese_data %>% pivot_longer(cols=c('X2015', 'X2016', 'X2017', 'X2018', 'X2019', 'X2020', 'X2021', 'X2022', 'X2023'),
                    names_to='year',
                    values_to='obesity_percentage')

calories_data <- calories_data %>% pivot_longer(cols=c('X2015', 'X2016', 'X2017', 'X2018', 'X2019', 'X2020', 'X2021', 'X2022', 'X2023'),
                    names_to='year',
                    values_to='calories_intake')


df= obese_data %>% inner_join(calories_data, by = c("Geography" = "Geography", "year" = "year"))

```

Now, we have a look at the new dataframe using glimpse function. Then we want to change calories intake into number and get rid of X in front of year.

```{r}
glimpse(df)
df <- df %>% mutate(calories_intake = as.numeric(gsub(",","",calories_intake)))
df <- df %>% mutate(year = gsub("X","", year))
```


## 1. Is there any relationship between the obesity prevalence and the daily calories intake? If yes, in what countries or regions? If no, in what countries or regions?


```{r fig.width=10}
ggplot(data = df %>% filter(Geography %in% c("World","Emerging and Developing Countries", "Developed Countries")),
       aes(x = calories_intake, y = obesity_percentage, color = Category.x, shape = Geography)) +
  geom_point(size=3) +
   scale_color_hue(labels = c("Female", "Male", "Average")) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") 

```



## 2. Which countries or regions have the highest percentage population of obesity? Which countries or regions have the lowest percentage population of obesity?

```{r}
df1 <- df %>% select(Geography, obesity_percentage, year, Category.x) %>%
  filter(Category.x == "Obese Population (BMI 30kg/sq m or More)") %>%
  filter(year =="2015") %>%
  arrange(obesity_percentage)

top <- df1 %>% slice_max(obesity_percentage, n = 5)
bottom <- df1 %>% slice_min(obesity_percentage, n = 5)
rbind(top,bottom) %>% arrange(obesity_percentage)

df2 <- df %>% select(Geography, obesity_percentage, year, Category.x) %>%
  filter(Category.x == "Obese Population (BMI 30kg/sq m or More)") %>%
  filter(year =="2016") %>%
  arrange(obesity_percentage)

df3 <- df %>% select(Geography, obesity_percentage, year, Category.x) %>%
  filter(Category.x == "Obese Population (BMI 30kg/sq m or More)") %>%
  filter(year =="2017") %>%
  arrange(obesity_percentage)

df4 <- df %>% select(Geography, obesity_percentage, year, Category.x) %>%
  filter(Category.x == "Obese Population (BMI 30kg/sq m or More)") %>%
  filter(year =="2018") %>%
  arrange(obesity_percentage)

df5 <- df %>% select(Geography, obesity_percentage, year, Category.x) %>%
  filter(Category.x == "Obese Population (BMI 30kg/sq m or More)") %>%
  filter(year =="2019") %>%
  arrange(obesity_percentage)

df6 <- df %>% select(Geography, obesity_percentage, year, Category.x) %>%
  filter(Category.x == "Obese Population (BMI 30kg/sq m or More)") %>%
  filter(year =="2020") %>%
  arrange(obesity_percentage)

df7 <- df %>% select(Geography, obesity_percentage, year, Category.x) %>%
  filter(Category.x == "Obese Population (BMI 30kg/sq m or More)") %>%
  filter(year =="2021") %>%
  arrange(obesity_percentage)

df8 <- df %>% select(Geography, obesity_percentage, year, Category.x) %>%
  filter(Category.x == "Obese Population (BMI 30kg/sq m or More)") %>%
  filter(year =="2022") %>%
  arrange(obesity_percentage)

df9 <- df %>% select(Geography, obesity_percentage, year, Category.x) %>%
  filter(Category.x == "Obese Population (BMI 30kg/sq m or More)") %>%
  filter(year =="2023") %>%
  arrange(obesity_percentage)

top <- df9 %>% slice_max(obesity_percentage, n = 5)
bottom <- df9 %>% slice_min(obesity_percentage, n = 5)
rbind(top,bottom) %>% arrange(obesity_percentage)

combined <- rbind(df1,df2,df3,df4,df5,df6,df7,df8,df9)

# plotting percentages by country over year
df %>% select(Geography, obesity_percentage, year, Category.x) %>%
  filter(Category.x == "Obese Population (BMI 30kg/sq m or More)") %>% 
  ggplot( aes(x = year, y = obesity_percentage, group = Geography)) + geom_line() 

# top 3 for each year
df %>% select(Geography, obesity_percentage, year, Category.x) %>%
  filter(Category.x == "Obese Population (BMI 30kg/sq m or More)") %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% slice_max(obesity_percentage, n = 3)

# bottom 3 for each year
df %>% select(Geography, obesity_percentage, year, Category.x) %>%
  filter(Category.x == "Obese Population (BMI 30kg/sq m or More)") %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% slice_min(obesity_percentage, n = 3)
```

### Is obesity increasing over years all over the world?

```{r fig.width=10}
df <- df %>% mutate(year = gsub("X","", year))

world_obe_year <- df %>% select(Geography, obesity_percentage, year) %>% 
  filter (Geography == "World"|Geography == "Emerging and Developing Countries"|Geography == "Developed Countries")

ggplot(world_obe_year, aes(x= year, y= obesity_percentage)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity", fill="pink") +
  facet_wrap(~Geography) +
  theme_bw()
```

## 3. In the world, are male or female more likely to have obesity? In which countries or regions, male are more likely have obesity? In which countries or regions, female are more likely have obesity?


```{r fig.width=10}
df %>% select(Geography, obesity_percentage, year, Category.x) %>%
  filter(Geography == "World") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y= obesity_percentage, group =Category.x)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = Category.x)) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")  
   #scale_color_hue(labels = c("Female", "Male", "Average"))

```
In the world, females are more likely to have obesity than males.

In both the developed countries and the emerging and developing countries, females are more likely to have obesity than males. However, the differences between the obesity prevalence of female and males in the developing countries are much larger than in the developed countries.

```{r fig.width=10}
df %>% select(Geography, obesity_percentage, year, Category.x) %>%
  filter(Geography == "Developed Countries" | Geography == "Emerging and Developing Countries") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y= obesity_percentage, group = Category.x)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = Category.x)) +
  facet_wrap(~Geography) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

```

In both the developed countries and the emerging and developing countries, females are more likely to have obesity than males. However, the differences between the obesity prevalence of female and males in the developing countries are much larger than in the developed countries.

## 4. Is obesity more prevalent in the underdeveloped countries or in the developed countries? Are the countries in G7/G20 have percentage of population of obesity than the rest of the world?

```{r fig.width=10}
df %>% select(Geography, obesity_percentage, year, Category.x) %>%
  filter(Geography == "Developed Countries"|Geography == "Emerging and Developing Countries" |Geography == "World" ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y= obesity_percentage, group=Geography)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = Geography)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Geography)) + 
  facet_wrap(~Category.x) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```
In general, the prevalence of obesity in the developed countries is greater than in the developing countries in both males and females.

Let's look at the biggest 5 economy in the world: USA, China, Japan, UK, and Germany.

```{r fig.width=10}
df %>% select(Geography, obesity_percentage, year, Category.x) %>%
  filter(Geography == "USA"|Geography == "Japan"|Geography=="China"| Geography =="Germany"|Geography =="United Kingdom" ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y= obesity_percentage, group =Geography)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = Geography)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Geography)) + 
  facet_wrap(~Category.x) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```
Now, we create a column of G7 or not, and a column of average of obesity percentage of G7 or not.

```{r fig.width=10}
df <- df %>% mutate(g7_or_not = case_when(Geography == "United Kingdom" ~ "G7",
                                          Geography == "USA" ~ "G7",
                                          Geography == "Canada" ~ "G7",
                                          Geography == "France" ~ "G7",
                                          Geography == "Germany" ~ "G7",
                                          Geography == "Japan" ~ "G7",
                                          Geography == "Italy" ~ "G7",
                                          Geography == "G7" ~ "G7",
                                          TRUE ~ "NotG7" # TRUE means else.
  ))
df <- df %>% group_by(g7_or_not) %>%
  mutate(mean_obesity_percentage_g7_or_not = mean(obesity_percentage))
df
```



```{r fig.width=7}
df %>% select(g7_or_not, obesity_percentage, year, Category.x, mean_obesity_percentage_g7_or_not) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = g7_or_not, y = mean_obesity_percentage_g7_or_not)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```


                             


## Summary

There is a positive correlation between obesity prevalence and the daily calories intake everywhere in the world, in both males and females.

The prevalence of obesity is higher in the developed countries than the developing countries.

The whole world is eating more and the percentage of population with obesity is increasing.

Females are more likely to have obesity than males everywhere in the world. However, the differences between the obesity prevalence of female and males in the developing countries are much larger than in the developed countries.

BMI is not a good indicator for obesity in some regions like Samoa.
